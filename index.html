        <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">Software Engineer Based Out Of Houston</p>
        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>I am a full-stack developer located in Houston Texas. After earning my degree from university I tried on several different
                hats in a few years before COVID decided that I didn't need a job anymore and commanded my employer at the time to lay me off,
                despite the fact that I had a one month old newborn son and rent requirements. It was a strange, unsettling time. I didn't know what
                to do or where I should turn next, and then I found programming. I instantly became hookded and I haven't looked back since. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am more than eager to begin my career as a software engineer. I want to embark on a journey that will 
                grow my skills as a contributing member of society and I want to ensure that my livlihood and those in it 
                will forever have a place here in this era of technology and learning.
